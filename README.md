### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

This design draws inspiration from geometric wallpapers and aims to create a seamless illusion. Circles are generated using a grid and ellipse size, with the center left bare by not drawing circles there. 

Changing the grid and ellipse size can drastically alter the appearance of the animation. The four hex codes at the top can be easily changed to customize the colors. A gradient or similar colors work best, as using too many different colors can result in a messy and jittery animation. The grid size is relative to the canvas, ensuring a similar look at different resolutions.
